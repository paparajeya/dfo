# Dispersive Flies Optimisation - Python Version

## Installation

### Using Docker Container

First, navigate to the **py** folder by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd py/
```

Make sure you have ```.env``` file in this folder. If not then create and insert these ```ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES``` (template ```.env-dev``` can be used for this purpose; but make sure this file content is copied into ```.env``` file and all ```changethis``` values are replaced appropriately.):

```bash
REDIS_PASSWORD=******************
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_HTTP_PORT=8001
REDIS_SERVER=redis
REDIS_DB=0
REDIS_EXPIRY=-1

ENVIRONMENT=local

LOG_DIR=logs/
LOG_FILE=${ENVIRONMENT}_dfo.log
ISSUE_FILE=${ENVIRONMENT}_dfo_issues.log
LOG_INTERVAL=midnight
MODE_LOG=debug
BACKUP_COUNT=7
```

Make sure you replace the ```ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES``` above with your own values.

If you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) already installed, then use the following command to run the code in the docker container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The cached DFO data can be accessed/viewed via Redis Cache at [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001). The default database is set to '0'. If you wish to change this, modify the ```REDIS_DB``` value in the ```ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES```. Then, incorporate this change into the URL to view the content of the desired database.

- When ```REDIS_EXPIRY``` is set to negative value, the will become permanent. If you want to expire the data by certain time, adjust this value in seconds.
