# Dispersive Flies Optimisation - Python Version

## Installation

### Using Docker Container

First, navigate to the **py** folder by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd py/
```

Make sure you have **.env** file in this folder. If not then create and insert these ```ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES```:

```bash

If you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) already installed, then use the following command to run the code in the docker container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
